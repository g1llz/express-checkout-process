# Express checkout process (house plant 🌱)

## The project

The challenge was fun and I using this opportunity to learn a little NextJs. I choosing to code with TypeScript because I use it every day and I feel more comfortable making this challenge with it. I put the max of the unit test that I could and I try to make a code clean and readable.

I had difficult creating a cool layout and I spend time thinking about it, but in the end, I don't like this layout.  
I chose to create the styles using "styled-components" and I try to make the elements reused and responsive, but I know it was a little mess.

Anyway, I enjoyed this process. :metal:

## ✔️ Wat was done

- [x] Products page
- [x] Mini cart
- [x] Checkout page
- [x] Success page
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Deploy on **vercel**

## 😬 What cold be improved

- The layout is really simple and the responsive could be better;
- The organization of **styled-components** is a little mess;
- Add transitions between pages

## 🔥 Getting Started

First, install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

...and run tests! 🚀

```bash
npm run test
# or
npm run test-coverage
```

You can run the development server to see the result or visit the example on vercel.

Before running the development mode first rename the `.env.example` to `.env`. Now you can start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
